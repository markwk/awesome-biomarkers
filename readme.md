Learn more about blood testing, biomarkers and tech and services to help quantify (and improve) your health! 

At its core, this project has two objectives: First, to be an awesome list about biomarkers, blood testing, blood tracking and quantified metrics about health and welness. That way you can learn all the basic info about blood tests and biomarker track. Second, to be an open source and community database on and about biomarkers. That way we can build great technologies for indiviudals, companies and communities hoping to use biomarkers and health metrics to power their solutions.  

# Awesome List on Biomarkers

> A curated list of biomarkers, blood tests, health indicators, blood testing companies and health tracking and analytics technologies, applications, tools and resources. 

## Common Blood Test Panels 

* **Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Differential** - Measures the numbers and percentages of various blood cell types in a blood sample. CBC is one of the most common tests used to assess and monitor overall health status.
* **Lipids Panel** - Tests the fatty substances found in blood, High level of triglycerides and cholesterol are associated with increased risk of heart-related problems.  
* **Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)** - Tests electrolyte levels, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. One of the most common tests used by health care providers. Consists of seven or eight biochemical tests. Used to assess and monitor overall health status, response to medication and medical therapies, and indicators of metabolic functioning. 
* **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)** - Tests kidney function, liver function, diabetic and parathyroid status, and electrolyte and fluid balance. The CMP includes a panel of 14 blood tests and is an expanded version of the basic metabolic panel (BMP), which includes liver tests. Also know as Chemical Screen or Complete Metabolic Panel 14 (CMP 14). 

## Specific Biomarkers and Blood Tests

#### Complete Blood Count (CBC) Biomarkers:

1. **RBC**: Red blood cell count (corpuscles). Red blood cells are made in the bone marrow and broken down in the spleen and liver. May be elevated due to dehydration, high testosterone. May be low due to nutrient deficiencies (iron, Vit B6, Vit B12, folate), kidney dysfunction, chronic inflammation, anemia, blood loss.
2. **Hemoglobin**: Delivers oxygen throughout the blood. May be elevated due to dehydration, elevated testosterone, poor oxygen deliverability, thiamin deficiency, insulin resistance. May be deceased due to anemia, liver disease, hypothyroidism, exercise, arginine deficiency, protein deficiency, inflammation nutrient deficiencies (Vit E, magnesium, zinc, copper, selenium, Vit B6, Vit A).
3. **Hematocrit**: Percentage of volume of blood composed of red blood cells. May be elevated due to dehydration, elevated testosterone, poor oxygen deliverability, thiamin deficiency, insulin resistance. May be deceased due to anemia, liver disease, hypothyroidism, exercise, arginine deficiency, protein deficiency, inflammation nutrient deficiencies (Vit E, magnesium, zinc, copper, selenium, Vit B6, Vit A).
4. **MCV**: Mean Corpuscular Volume. An estimate of the average red blood cell size. May be elevated (“macrocytic”) due to nutrient deficiencies (Vit B12, folate, Vit C), alcohol consumption, thiamin deficiency. May be decreased (“microcytic”) due to iron deficiency, nutrient deficiencies (Vit B6, copper, zinc, Vit A, Vit C).
5. **MCH**: Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin. A measure of the average weight of hemoglobin per red blood cell. May be elevated (“macrocytic”) due to nutrient deficiencies (Vit B12, folate, Vit C), alcohol consumption, thiamin deficiency, and (falsely increased) by hyperlipidemia. May be decreased (“microcytic”) due to iron deficiency, nutrient deficiencies (Vit B6, copper, zinc, Vit A, Vit C).
6. **MCHC**: Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration. Measures the average concentration of hemoglobin in red blood cells. May be elevated (“macrocytic”) due to nutrient deficiencies (Vit B12, folate, Vit C), alcohol consumption, thiamin deficiency, and (falsely increased) by hyperlipidemia. May be decreased (“microcytic”) due to iron deficiency, nutrient deficiencies (Vit B6, copper, zinc, Vit A, Vit C).
7. **Platelets**: Small, anucleated cell fragments in blood that are involved in clotting and important for vascular integrity.

MPV may be decreased due to conditions associated with under-production of platelets such as aplastic anemia or cytotoxic drug therapy.
9. **RDW**: Red blood cell distribution width. A measurement of the variation in red blood cell size. Typically increased due to nutrient deficiency-related anemias (iron, Vit A, copper, zinc, Vit B6).
