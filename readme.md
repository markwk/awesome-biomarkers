## Objectives

This project has a couple objectives: 

- First, to be an **awesome list about biomarkers**, blood testing, blood tracking and quantified metrics about health and wellness. That way you can learn all the basic info about blood tests and biomarker track. 
- Second, to provide a **biomarker tracker** so everyone has a user friendly tools for tracking and monitoring your blood biomarkers over time. Right now our recommended solution is a Google Sheets biomarker tracker. 
- Third, to be an **open source and community database on biomarkers**, blood test ranges and various research about these numbers. That way we can get reliable numbers and build more advanced technologies for individuals, companies and communities hoping to use biomarkers and health metrics to power the revolution in data-driven health.  

Feel free to use, comment, share, contribute. This is very much a collaborative effort at open source citizen science!

## Common Blood Test Panels

- [Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_blood_count) - Measures the numbers and percentages of various blood cell types in a blood sample. CBC is one of the most common tests used to assess and monitor overall health status.
- [Lipids Panel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_profile) - Tests the fatty substances found in blood, High level of triglycerides and cholesterol are associated with increased risk of heart-related problems.  
- [Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_metabolic_panel) - Tests electrolyte levels, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. One of the most common tests used by health care providers. Consists of seven or eight biochemical tests. Used to assess and monitor overall health status, response to medication and medical therapies, and indicators of metabolic functioning. 
- [Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_metabolic_panel) - Tests kidney function, liver function, diabetic and parathyroid status, and electrolyte and fluid balance. The CMP includes a panel of 14 blood tests and is an expanded version of the basic metabolic panel (BMP), which includes liver tests.

[Get Biomarker Tracker for Google Sheets Now](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gpESrmjD6TpOIlYB0-tu9uZk2fRaHkgFAsMPK9mzMKQ/edit?usp=sharing)

**Biomarker Tracker** is a tracking tool for lab and blood test results. It is simple tool for logging and tracking your blood and other biomarker data. Built and shared as a Google Sheets template, it provides a way to record your test results and see if they are in or out of the target ranges.  

The tracker currently provides several panels:

- Biomarker Tracker - Highlights key health and wellness biomarkers and a target goal
- CBC
- Chemistry
- Lipids
- Advanced - an example sheet for custom logging of additional biomarkers

Ranges can be adjusted according to your lab, doctor or own targets. Based on targets, conditional formatted will highlight results outside of the range. 

### How to Use the Blood Tests Tracker

## BiomarkerDB

> An Open Source Database on Biomarkers and Health Metrics

While there are a number of sources on blood testing, biomarkers and medical testing, they are often difficult to navigate, non-digital and/or proprietary. In order to provide access to latest info on blood testing and biomarker ranges and research, we are building an open source database and directory on biomarkers: **[Biomarker DB](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WVhjSNUQh4xuc41cLuChE-DthZzEemHxeHghbCdQ2sA/edit?usp=sharing)**. 

This database is intended as a reliable source about the most common, researched and used biomarkers for health and wellness. It is open source and community built.  

**Update 8/8/19**: In order to speed development and community involvement, the latest version of the database and directory is being made available in Google Sheets [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WVhjSNUQh4xuc41cLuChE-DthZzEemHxeHghbCdQ2sA/edit?usp=sharing). Feel free to add and contribute. 

We intend to then transfer this into an alternative format that get be managed in code / git at a later time.
